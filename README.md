Project Description: 

A simple todo list application putting together basic front end concepts taught in Angela Yu's "The Complete 2020 Wev Development Bootcamp." This uses Express on node.js to create a stand alone application that allows a user to input a customized todo list for today's date. It also contains the ability to create a "work list" to separate day tasks from work tasks. 

How to build:

1. git clone https://github.com/shreyamalik19/simple-todolist.git
2. npm i (this should create node_modules folder using dependencies defined in package.json)

How to run and use application: 

1. node app.js (or use nodemon for server monitoring)
2. Open up browser to localhost:3000 to pull up a customizable todo list for today's date. 
3. The list comes pre populated with two tasks I enjoy in my daily routine, yoga and meditation. 
4. Add tasks for the day as necessary. Head over to localhost:3000/work to add in a list dedicated to work. This list will not be concatenated to tasks on the original todolist.
5. Cross off as the tasks are slowly completed :)

Enjoy!
